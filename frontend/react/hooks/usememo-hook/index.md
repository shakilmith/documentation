# React useMemo Hook


The **useMemo** hook is a part of React and is used to optimize performance by memoizing the results of expensive calculations or functions. It ensures that a value is recalculated only when its dependencies change. 

Here, useMemo and useCallback almost use for same purposes. Both prevents unnecessary rerendering. But, useMemo returns memorized value and useCallback returns memorized function.
