## 1: Write a letter about the benefits of plating trees

Dear friend,
I have received your latter last week and you have wanted to know about the benefits of planting trees in your letter. Now I am writing to you about it.

Trees are our best friends. They give us fruit and timber. Fruits are a great source of vitamins and minerals. Timbers are used to build furniture in order to decorate our houses. Trees maintain ecological balance. They prevent the soil erosion. They also prevent desertification by causing rainfall. But there are many dishonest people who cut trees illegally and destroy our woods and forests. We shall do well to stop such thoughtless acts and fill up the gaps caused by such destruction. Such as, we can plant trees in the premises of our houses, schools, colleges, hospitals, banks and other institutions. Besides, we should take active part in the government's or non-government's annual tree plantation programmes. 

I hope, you will agree with me and will do the needful. Please let me know about your activities in the sphere.
So much for the present. I am well. Hope, this finds you in good health and sprits.
Your friend,
Rebeka.
